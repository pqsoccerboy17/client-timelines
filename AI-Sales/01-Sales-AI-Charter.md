# EasyVista Sales AI Enablement Charter

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** February 2026
**Owner:** Mike Duncan
**Sponsor:** Evan Carlson (COO)

---

## Executive Summary

This charter establishes the scope, objectives, and governance for EasyVista's Sales and GTM AI enablement initiative. The program spans two workstreams—Dripify (LinkedIn automation) and Loopio (RFP standardization)—with the goal of measurably improving sales productivity and creating an investor-ready AI adoption narrative by Q1 2026.

---

## Business Context

### Why Now?

- EasyVista is preparing for capital fundraising and needs demonstrable AI ROI
- Current BDR opportunity generation sits at 15-20/quarter; target is 25-30
- Loopio adoption is inconsistent globally, with shadow IT risk (ChatGPT usage)
- Q1 2026 provides a natural checkpoint with hard deadline of March 31

### Strategic Alignment

This initiative directly supports EasyVista's investor narrative:

> "We implemented AI across BDR outbound and RFP response, leading to X% more opportunities, Y% pipeline uplift, and Z% higher efficiency, while scaling without proportional headcount increase."
