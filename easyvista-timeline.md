# EasyVista Engagement Timeline
## Internal Review Document | January 21, 2026

**Prepared for:** Mike Duncan & Henry Yelin  
**Deadline:** Q1 2026 (March 31, 2026)  
**Days Remaining:** ~70 days

---

## Executive Summary

This document captures the complete timeline from current state to Q1 completion for the EasyVista AI GTM Assessment. Our deliverables span two primary workstreams (Dripify + Loopio) plus ongoing technical due diligence support. Success requires coordinating across five geographic regions, multiple stakeholder groups, and tight budget constraints ($10-15K).

---

## Current State (As of Jan 21, 2026)

### What's Been Completed
- Discovery phase with leadership (Patrice, Evan, Alexander)
- Tech stack audit (12+ tools mapped)
- Stakeholder mapping (12 key contacts identified)
- Four AI initiatives identified and prioritized
- Budget confirmed ($10-15K, up to $20K if ROI clear)
- Q1 timeline locked in

### What's In Flight
- Stakeholder outreach emails sent to BDR leads (Tim, Cedric, Christopher)
- Stakeholder outreach emails sent to Pre-sales leads (Dalila, Jan)
- Technical due diligence concerns raised; deep-dive pending

### Key Risks Identified
1. Rod bypassing Loopio for ChatGPT (change management issue)
2. France adoption requires local buy-in ("needs to be France's idea")
3. Germany excluded due to works council complexity
4. Engineering over-committed; April release non-negotiable
5. No underlying sales methodology (foundational gap)

## Investor Narrative Requirements

Our deliverables must support Evan/Patrice's investor communications. The narrative should demonstrate:

1. **Adoption metrics:** % of team using AI tools, frequency, which processes
2. **BDR metrics:** Opportunities per quarter (baseline → target)
3. **Pipeline metrics:** Added pipeline attributed to AI-enhanced processes
4. **Efficiency metrics:** RFP turnaround time, manager coaching time reduction

**Talking Points Template:**
> "We implemented AI across BDR outbound and RFP response, leading to X% more opportunities, Y% pipeline uplift, and Z% higher efficiency, while scaling without proportional headcount increase."

## Open Questions (To Resolve This Week)

- [ ] Who are the France stakeholders beyond Cedric to engage?
- [ ] Why does Rod prefer ChatGPT over Loopio? (Detailed understanding needed)
- [ ] What specific metrics does Loopio track that we can use?
- [ ] What's the baseline BDR opportunity count by geography and experience level?
- [ ] When can we schedule the tech DD deep-dive?

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Stakeholder non-response | Medium | High | Follow-up cadence; Evan escalation path |
| France adoption resistance | High | High | Henry involvement; "France's idea" positioning |
| Dripify technical issues | Low | Medium | Pilot phase catches before broad rollout |
| Rod continues ChatGPT usage | High | Medium | Direct conversation; understand root cause |
| Q1 timeline slip | Medium | High | Weekly tracking; early escalation |
| Budget constraints limit scope | Low | Medium | Prioritize quick wins; phased approach |
